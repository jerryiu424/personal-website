        If it isn't already obvious from the landing page, I would consider
        myself a mechancial keyboard enthusiaist. I got into this hobby about
        two months into my first RBC internship, which you can read more in the
        experience tab. I've now built about 3 keyboards and I already want to
        build more ü•≤

        I‚Äôm a huge pokemon nerd. The first pokemon game that I played was
        platinum, however I started following the franchise long before I
        started playing. I remember waking up early on Sunday mornings to catch
        an episode of the show or watching a pokemon movie while my mom is
        giving me a haircut at home.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you were to ask what my favorite pokemon is, it has got to be Piplup.
        The fierce fluffy penguin pokemon has a never back down mentality that I
        can resonate with. I always strive for excellence in my work. Let it be
        following the best practices of building an API or making sure the 12th
        factors are followed when building a cloud application, I hold myself to
        a high degree of standard such that excellency can be achieved.

        I am also an avid gamer. Some of the games that I‚Äôve been enjoying
        lately include pokemon brilliant diamond & shining pearl, pokemon unite
        (I really like pokemon ... can‚Äôt you tell?), valorant and teamfight
        tactics.

        On top of playing video games, I enjoy playing and watching various kind
        of sports in my off-time too! I was a defensive coach for my residence‚Äôs
        flag football team and played a key role in leading both the women‚Äôs and
        men‚Äôs team to championship for 3 years in a row.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, in terms of watching professional sports, my favorite sports
        team has got to be Borussia Dortmund, a German football club. I have
        been a fan of theirs since they made their champions league final
        appearance in 2012.
